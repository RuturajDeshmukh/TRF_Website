## Do not Forget to these things

1) Always comment your code, this is important as sometime, someone else may have to deal with your code. Try to write atleast 2 lines of comment for every 10 line of code

2) If you want to set any Session variable, then always make use of Constants, so that other team members can easily see what all Sessions are already set by you and they do not create multiple Session variables for same thing.
